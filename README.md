# ArtBlog

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](<https://github.com/angular/angular-cli>) version 16.0.2.

## Development server

To start the development server, run `ng serve` and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files. This way, you can easily preview your changes without having to rebuild the project or manually refresh the page.

## Check the current product

To check the current product, simply click [<https://artist-blog-one.vercel.app>](<https://artist-blog-one.vercel.app/>). There's no need to download or install anything. This is a great way to show your work to others or to check how it looks on different devices.

## Code scaffolding

To generate a new component, run `ng generate component component-name`. This will create a new folder with the specified name, containing the necessary files for a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module` for other types of scaffolding.

## Build

To build the project, run `ng build`. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. You can also use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](<https://karma-runner.github.io/>). This will run the tests in a headless browser and report the results in the terminal. You can also use the `--watch` flag to run the tests automatically whenever a file changes.
